#Critical Making

Based on Matt Ratto's [critical making workshop](http://blog.humlab.umu.se/?p=5274) where they make 'fixels' - a paper pixel


###Purpose:
- to visualise the linkages between digital and physical worlds
- to visualise how society and technology create each other and develop interdependently
- to get students to understand what the technical choices they make mean and the impact they have on society in general


###Things to make:
- a pixel
- the internet
- wifi
- bits, bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terrabytes
- the cloud
