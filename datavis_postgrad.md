#DATA VISUALISATION & DIGITAL ART
TYPE: Workshop Outline
LEVEL: Postgraduate students
AUTHOR: Dr Pip Shea##SummaryThis workshop is for artist-researchers who are interested in investigating the politics, ethics, and practices of data visualisation. We will explore and critique different vectors of data art to develop a deeper understanding of what might be achieved by visualising unseen relations. Participants will be encouraged to fix a critical lens to their own visualisation processes by acknowledging the biases of datasets, the power dynamics embedded in data infrastructures, and the responsibilities attached to using visualisation as a form of measurement, analysis, or art making.###Activities:1.	An introduction to visual communication and information design theories.2.	Discussion: the politics of visual data representation.3.	Case studies: contemporary approaches to data art/visualization.4.	Exercise: investigate the entanglements of digital design and digital art.5.	Discussion: if data is a “cultural resource” (Gitelman 2013) what responsibilities do digital arts and humanities researchers have regarding the generation, protection, and interpretation of data? 6.	Exercise: investigate the dynamics of data creation, storage, and delivery through the lens of software criticism.7.	Exercise: use Critical Making approaches to reveal more nuanced data stories.###Case Studies:-	Border Bumping, Julian Oliver http://www.andfestival.org.uk/events/border-bumping/ -	Livewire, Natalie Jeremijenko http://tech90s.walkerart.org/nj/transcript/nj_04.html-	Art Made of Storms, Natalie Miebach https://www.ted.com/talks/nathalie_miebach -	The Sheep Market, Aaron Koblin  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mmb5aSscck-	Tōhoku Japanese Earthquake Sculpture, Luke Jerramhttp://www.lukejerram.com/projects/t%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake -	Chromatic News, Natalie Hopsonhttp://vimeo.com/41356007 ###Reading list:-	[Art Against Information: Case Studies in Data Practice, Mitchell Whitelaw](http://eleven.fibreculturejournal.org/fcj-067-art-against-information-case-studies-in-data-practice/)-	[Raw Data is an Oxymoron, Lisa Gitelman (Ed)](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/raw-data-oxymoron)-	[The Anti-Sublime Ideal in Data Art, Lev Manovich](http://meetopia.net/virus/pdf-ps_db/LManovich_data_art.pdf)-	[Think Again: Big Data, Kate Crawford](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/10/think-again-big-data/)-	[Playing with Complexity: An Approach to Exploratory Data Visualisation, Butler et al.](http://acuads.com.au/static/files/assets/c06364cd/Ennis-Butler_Ben_Hinton_Sam_Whitelaw_Mitchell_Paper.pdf)-	[Critical Making: Conceptual and Material Studies in Technology and Social Life, Matt Ratto](http://com327ncsu.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ratto_criticalmaking.pdf)-	[Evil Media, Matthew Fuller and Andrew Goffey](http://neural.it/2013/02/matthew-fuller-andrew-goffey-evil-media/)-	[A Critical Reflection on Big Data: Considering APIs, Researchers and Tools as Data Makers, Farida Vis](http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4878)
